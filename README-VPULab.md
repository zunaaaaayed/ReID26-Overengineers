# Urban-Elements-ReID---baseline
In this repository, you can find instructions on how to download, configure, and run the baseline for the [Urban Elements ReID competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/urban-elements-re-id-challenge-2026/overview).

## Download code and set up enviroment
To download the main code and set up the environment, please follow the instructions only up to downloading the pre-trained model (step 3) of [Part Aware Transformer](https://github.com/liyuke65535/Part-Aware-Transformer).

## Modified codes
In order to use PAT for the [Urban Elements ReID competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/urban-elements-re-id-challenge-2026/overview) follow the next steps:

### 1) Download the UrbanElementsReID dataset
Download the UrbanElementsReID dataset from the section [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/urban-elements-re-id-challenge-2026/data) in the Kaggle competition page and place it in the directory of your choice.

Once the dataset is downloaded (If the file structure does not look right, please refer to setup.sh.), run the `setup.sh` script over the dataset directoy in order to place the folders in the correct way. You can find this script in `/Codes/setup.sh`

```bash
cd "your data directory"
```

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

If needed give permissions to access the folders running
```bash
chmod +x "folder name"
```


### 2) Add the required files
Add to the folder `Part-Aware-Transformer/data/datasets/` the dataloaders and initialization files `UrbanElementsReID.py`, `UrbanElementsReID_test.py` and `__init__.py`.

Add to `Part-Aware-Transformer/config/` folder and set up the correspondig paths and configuration of `UrbanElementsReID_test.yml` and `UrbanElementsReID_train.yml` files.

Add to `Part-Aware-Transformer/utils/` the file `re_rankig.py`.

Add to `Part-Aware-Transformer/` the evaluation files `update.py` and `evaluate_csv.py`

### 3) Set up configuration files

Modify the configuration files `UrbanElementsReID_test.yml` and `UrbanElementsReID_train.yml` and set up your path to the data directory (DATASET:ROOT_DIR), pretrained model weigths (MODEL:PRETRAIN_PATH and TEST:WEIGHT) and output directory.

### 4) Train the model
In order to train the model first make sure that all the configuration settings and paths are correct. Then run the following line:

```bash
python train.py --config_file "config/UrbanElementsReID_train.yml"
```

### 5) Inference (Result Track Submission Generation)
To generate the final ranking for the competition, use the update.py script. This will process the test images and create a track_submission.csv file containing the top 100 candidates for each query. This file is what you typically upload to Kaggle or use for final scoring.

```bash
python update.py --config_file "config/UrbanElementsReID_test.yml" --track "path to store the files/track"
```
### 6) Local Evaluation (mAP & CMC Metrics)
If you want to calculate the performance of your model locally (without uploading to Kaggle) in the [UAM dataset external data](http://www-vpu.eps.uam.es/challenges/UrbanReIDChallenge2026//), use the evaluation script. This script compares your generated track_submission.csv against the ground truth (query.csv and test.csv) to calculate Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) curves.
```bash
python evaluate_csv.py --path "path/to/dataset/csv_folder/" --track "path/to/track_submission.csv"
```
